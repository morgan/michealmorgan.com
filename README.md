# Mícheál Morgan Landing

## Summary

Personal landing page for [michealmorgan.com](michealmorgan.com).

Let's face it, we update our personal sites once in a blue moon. This go around, I wanted something that used the least amount of tech as possible. Something that when I go to perform an update in however many months/years, there are no frameworks or dead JavaScript to tend to. Just plain old HTML and CSS. 

## Technical Objectives

- No JavaScript
- Minimalistic code
- Responsive
- Single external library for CSS resets [https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/](normalize.css)
- Self contained with no outside dependencies - *Other than Google Analytics phoning home*
- Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for TLS via a reverse proxy

## Content Objectives

- One large recent photo of yours truly
- Relevant links to work, social media, etc
- Summary of who I am and what I love
